                        <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</em> is fondly remembered as one of the greatest games of my youth.
                        What's not to love about beating up bad guys and having some Pizza along the way as some of the most radical dudes around?
                        You and a friend can play as any of the four turtles, each with their own awesome moves, as you make your way from New York to the ends of time.
                        The entire game is only a few hours long, so if you haven't played it, make an afternoon of it - order some Pizza, and have a great time!

                        In a franchise as beloved as Mega Man, there have been a lot of excellent titles - <em>Mega Man X</em>, however, has to be near, or at the very top of the list.
                        When compared to the NES games that came before, <em>Mega Man X</em> was an improvement in virtually every way.
                        From the visuals, to the gameplay, the level design, and the music, everything just came together to create this timeless classic we all know today.
                        Plus, getting to play as a futuristic robot that is saving the world from other evil robots is just plain... cool.

                        <em>Chrono Trigger</em> is easily one of my all time favorite games on the SNES. It has a lot of character and
                        tells a grand story of time travel and paradoxes in a way that I had never before experienced.
                        With its branching story paths and multiple endings, it was one of the first of its kind with this unique gameplay.
                        If you're in the mood for a classic and got the time, all I can say is: It's worth it.

                        When you launch a new generation and want everybody to buy the newest console, who do you call? That's right, Mr. System Seller himself, Mario!
                        Seeing <em>Super Mario World</em> for the first time was mind-blowing. "Graphics will <em>never</em> be better than this!" I thought.
                        Can you blame me? This was a night and day difference with what came before. All the platforming goodness you know and love? All there.
                        Graphics better than real life? All there. Playable Yoshi? You best believe it. <em>Super Mario World</em> was everything a kid in the 90s could want.

                        What's there left to say about <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>? Arguably one of the greatest video games of all time.
                        It's the classic tale of a hero saving the world from evil while rescuing the Princess in the process. More importantly, however,
                        is the sense of adventure as you traverse through parallel worlds clearing out dungeons, solving puzzles, and fighting bosses.
                        There have been many like it, but none have been able to capture the magic that makes <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em> so great.
